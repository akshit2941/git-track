# Git-Track

This repository serves as a centralized log of all my Git commits across various repositories. Each commit is documented with details such as:

- Repository name
- Branch name
- Committed files
- Commit timestamp
- Additional metadata

## How It Works

1. Git commits made in any repository are logged here.
2. Each commit entry is stored in `.md` (Markdown) format for easy readability and tracking.
3. Metadata like tracking status, last commit timestamp, and sync status are included.
